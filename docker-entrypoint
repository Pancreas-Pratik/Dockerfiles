echo "    S1: Input the password as the instruction."
echo "    S2: Confirm the password and remember the port used by this VNC session."
echo "        This setting is only required when you first enter the container. If you want to change the password, use \"tigervncpasswd\" to do that."
echo "    S3: Check the host IP address returned from the screen."
echo "    S4: Run \"noVNC\" outside the container by \"$ noVNC IP=... PORT=...\" where \"PORT\" is optional."
echo "    S5: Check the URL returned by noVNC, and use a web browser to connect the desktop URL."
echo "    S6: Input the password which is set in S1."
echo "    S7: Now you would see the desktop has been launched"
echo "    S8: Enjoy your remote desktop. Note that you should not close both the terminal running the container and the default terminal of noVNC screen."
